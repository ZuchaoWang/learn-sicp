# learn-sicp

This is some python3 code, inspired from the algorithms described in the book [Structural and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_start). Each python file name is prefixed with the related section in the book, for example, "sicp122_count_change.py" is related to section 1.2.2 of the book.

However, the code does not strictly follow the book. First of all, I just write code for the algorithms I feel interesting. Secondly I write in python, not in lisp. Finally my implementation may be wildly different from that described in the book.

I will not write elaborate tests because I'm so lazy.
